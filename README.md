# Design Patterns
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems.

Design patterns are divided into three categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

## 1. Creational Design Patterns
Creational patterns provide different mechanisms for creating objects.

## 2. Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns describe how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.

## 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns define how objects communicate and assign responsibilities to one another.
