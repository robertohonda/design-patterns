# Design Patterns
Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring software design problems.

Design patterns are categorized into three main groups:
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

## 1. Creational Design Patterns
Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a flexible and reusable way.

## 2. Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger, flexible structures.

## 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities.
