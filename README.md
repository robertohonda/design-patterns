# Design Patterns
Design patterns are reusable solutions to commons software design problems.

Design Patterns are divided into 3 categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral.

## Creational Design Patterns
Creational patterns consist of different mechanisms used to create objects.

## Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns refer to how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.

## Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns control communication and the assignment of responsibilities between different objects.
